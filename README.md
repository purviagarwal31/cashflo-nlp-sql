#  NLP to SQL Query System with Semantic Layer

##  Overview
This project enables users to query a structured financial database using natural language.

It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) along with a **Semantic Layer** to convert user queries into SQL, execute them, and return results with clear explanations.

The system is designed to be **accurate, safe, and interpretable**, mimicking a real-world AI data assistant.

##  Key Features

-  Natural Language → SQL conversion
-  Semantic Layer for business understanding
-  SQL validation (blocks unsafe queries)
-  Retry mechanism for failed queries
-  Business-friendly query explanations
-  Automatic execution on database
-  Ambiguity detection (e.g., "top vendors")
-  Logging for observability

##  Why Semantic Layer?

Naive text-to-SQL systems often fail due to lack of business context.

We introduced a **semantic layer** to:

- Define business metrics (e.g., revenue, outstanding)
- Map synonyms (e.g., "bills" → invoices)
- Provide table and column descriptions
- Guide correct JOIN relationships

This significantly improves query accuracy and reliability.

##  Example Queries

### Example 1

**User Query:**
What is our revenue?

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(grand_total)
FROM invoices
WHERE status = 'paid';
Explanation:
Uses invoices table
Filters only paid invoices
Calculates total revenue
Example 2
User Query:
Compare revenue of each vendor and show top 5
Generated SQL:
SELECT vendors.name, SUM(invoices.grand_total) AS revenue
FROM invoices
JOIN vendors ON invoices.vendor_id = vendors.id
WHERE invoices.status = 'paid'
GROUP BY vendors.name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
Explanation:
Counts total number of invoices in the database.
