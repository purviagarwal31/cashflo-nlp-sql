# NLP-to-SQL System with Semantic Layer

### *(Cashflo Hiring Challenge – Problem B)*

## Problem Chosen

**Problem B: Semantic Layer on a Database for NLP-to-Query Conversion**

---

## Overview

This project builds an **AI-powered data analyst system** that allows users to query a financial database using natural language.

Instead of directly converting text → SQL, the system introduces a **Semantic Layer** to bridge the gap between business language and database schema.

### Example

> **User Query:** “Show me unpaid bills”
> **Interpretation:** invoices where status is not paid

---

## What the System Does

* Converts natural language → SQL
* Executes SQL on database
* Returns:

  * Query results
  * Human-readable explanation
  * Visualization suggestion

---

## System Architecture

```

Query Normalization

Semantic Layer (Context Injection)
   ↓
LLM (Groq - SQL Generation)

SQL Validation Layer

Query Execution (SQLite)
   ↓
Result + Explanation + Chart Suggestion
```

## Semantic Layer (Core Innovation)

The semantic layer provides **business context** to the LLM.

### Includes:

* **Table & Column Descriptions**
* **Relationships (JOIN paths)**
* **Business Metrics**

  * `revenue = SUM(grand_total WHERE status = 'paid')`
* **Synonyms**

  * bills → invoices
  * suppliers → vendors
* **Temporal Expressions**

  * last month
  * last quarter

This significantly improves SQL accuracy over naive text-to-SQL systems.

---

## Features

* Natural Language → SQL conversion
* Semantic-aware query generation
* SQL validation (blocks DELETE/DROP/UPDATE)
* Retry mechanism for failed queries
* Ambiguity handling (assumptions for vague queries)
* Interpretation-based explanations
* Chart suggestions (Bar / Line / Pie)
* Logging for observability

---

## NLP → SQL Pipeline (Detailed)

1. **User Query Input**
2. **Normalization Layer**

   * Converts synonyms (e.g., "bills" → invoices)
3. **Semantic Injection**

   * Injects schema, relationships, metrics, temporal rules
4. **LLM SQL Generation**

   * Generates structured SQL using strict prompting
5. **Validation Layer**

   * Blocks unsafe or incorrect SQL
6. **Execution Engine**

   * Runs query on SQLite database
7. **Post-processing**

   * Explanation generation
   * Chart suggestion

---

## Semantic Layer Coverage (Important for Evaluation)

The system explicitly defines:

* Table-level descriptions
* Column-level descriptions
* Relationships (multi-table joins)
* Business metrics (revenue, outstanding)
* Synonyms mapping
* Temporal mappings (last month, last quarter)

This ensures **high accuracy and domain awareness**.

---

## AI Tools Used

This project was developed using AI-assisted workflows:

### ChatGPT

* Prompt engineering
* Debugging and system design
* Iterated prompts multiple times for accuracy

### Groq (LLM: llama-3.3-70b-versatile)

* SQL generation
* Explanation generation

AI tools were used as **development accelerators**, not replacements for system design.

---

## Tradeoffs & Limitations

* Temporal queries depend on dataset availability (may return empty results)
* Explanation layer is rule-based + LLM-assisted (can be improved further)
* CLI-based system (no UI)
* No query caching or multi-turn conversations
* Some interpretations (e.g., “unpaid”) depend on dataset-specific status values

## Sample Queries & Outputs

### 1. Simple Query

**Input:**

```
How many invoices are there?
```

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices;
```

---

### 2. Synonym Handling

**Input:**

```
Show me all unpaid bills
```

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE status != 'paid';
```

---

### 3. Join Query

**Input:**

```
Show invoices with vendor names
```

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT invoices.id, vendors.name, invoices.grand_total
FROM invoices
JOIN vendors ON invoices.vendor_id = vendors.id;
```

---

### 4. Aggregation

**Input:**

```
What is total revenue?
```

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT SUM(grand_total)
FROM invoices
WHERE status = 'paid';
```

---

### 5. Window Function (Advanced)

**Input:**

```
Show running total of invoices for each vendor
```

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT 
  vendors.name,
  invoices.created_at,
  SUM(invoices.grand_total) OVER (
    PARTITION BY invoices.vendor_id
    ORDER BY invoices.created_at
  ) AS running_total
FROM invoices
JOIN vendors ON invoices.vendor_id = vendors.id;
```

---

### 6. Ranking

**Input:**

```
Rank vendors by total invoice value
```

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT 
  vendors.name,
  SUM(invoices.grand_total) AS total_value,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(invoices.grand_total) DESC) AS rank
FROM invoices
JOIN vendors ON invoices.vendor_id = vendors.id
GROUP BY vendors.name;
```

---

## Future Improvements

* Multi-turn conversational queries
* Query caching and reuse
* UI dashboard for visualization
* Schema auto-discovery

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining **LLMs with a semantic layer** enables accurate, explainable, and production-ready natural language querying over structured databases.

It goes beyond naive text-to-SQL systems and moves toward a **real-world AI data assistant**.
